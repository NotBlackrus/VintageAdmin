This github repository is simply just for me to place all my programming for Vintage Admin in one place, because apparently I can't apply for the scripter role in Hidden Devs with the roblox free model of Vintage Admin that everyone can use...
What a bunch of hippy, dippy, baloney.

I don't suggest using this code considering it does not have the instances layout, and is just a collection of all the coding.
As well as this, the code may be outdated! Current version as of uploading this: 1.1.6

I almost NEVER use github. Might use it later on, but definitely not now, so please excuse me if this isn't ordered/created correctly.
